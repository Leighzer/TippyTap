# TippyTap
A simple c# console game that supplies random words from a large [(~370K)](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words/blob/master/words_dictionary.json) list for the user to type.

Once all words are typed, the user is presented with a few basic stats on their typing.

# Usage
./TippyTap numberOfWordsToType
./TippyTap

Launching TippyTap without arguments launches it in 'infinity' mode.
